## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask --force amalshaji/taps/dbcooper
```

Homebrew clears the Gatekeeper quarantine automatically, so the app opens right away.

### Direct download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/amalshaji/dbcooper/releases).

**macOS users:** After installing (**before opening the app the first time**), bypass Gatekeeper since the app isn't notarized:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/DBcooper.app
```
Then you can open the app normally.

### AI SQL Generation

To use AI-powered SQL generation:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) and configure your OpenAI API settings:
   - **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (required)
   - **Endpoint**: Custom endpoint URL (optional, defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1`)

2. In the **Query Editor**, you'll see an instruction input above the SQL editor:
   - Type a natural language description (e.g., "show all users with posts from last week")
   - Click **Generate** or press Enter
   - Watch as SQL streams into the editor in real-time

The AI uses GPT-4.1 and has access to your database schema (tables and columns) for accurate query generation.

## Building

The app is configured to build for macOS ARM (Apple Silicon). The build process:

1. Creates optimized production bundles
2. Signs the app with your signing key
3. Generates updater artifacts

## Releases

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To publish a new version:

1. Update `version` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
2. Open a PR and add the `release` label
3. Merge the PR into `main`
4. GitHub Actions will create and push the tag (e.g., `v0.0.42`), then build a draft release
5. Review and publish the release

### Required Secrets

Set these in your GitHub repository settings:

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` - Contents of your signing key file
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` - Password (if set)
